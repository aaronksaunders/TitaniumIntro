Titanium Introduction and Overview

Slides (PowerPoint and Keynote) introduce the basic features of the Titanium mobile development platform.

Two projects:

MapDemo - meant to show how simple it is to create an app that would involve a fair bit of code in Java/ObjectiveC. This one just creates a map with a single annotation and event listener.

RSSReader - shows a more complex app, built in the module CommonJS require() pattern. It uses event messaging, networking, XML parsing, and web views.
